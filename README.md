# NPCC-140 Bus System Visualization

## Overview
This project provides a geospatial visualization of the **NPCC-140 Bus test system**, which spans across the northeastern region of the United States and parts of Canada. The visualization displays the **electric power transmission network**â€”including buses, transmission lines, and transformersâ€”using interactive map layers.

The NPCC-140 system is widely used in power systems research for **grid planning, stability studies, and reliability analysis**. This map makes it easier to understand the geographical distribution of the network and the interconnections between areas.

## Features
- **Interactive Map Layers**
  - Toggle between basemap styles (`OpenStreetMap`, `Terrain`, `Positron`).
  - Select/deselect display of **Buses**, **Transmission Lines**, and **Transformers**.
- **Voltage Level Classification**
  - Transmission lines color-coded by nominal voltage:
    - **Purple**: < 100 kV  
    - **Black**: 100â€“200 kV  
    - **Blue**: 220/230 kV  
    - **Red**: 345 kV  
    - **Orange**: 500 kV
- **Regional Grouping**
  - Buses are categorized by operational area:
    - ðŸŸ¥ **ISO-NE** (New England) â€“ 36 buses  
    - ðŸŸ¦ **NYISO Upstate** â€“ 36 buses  
    - ðŸŸ© **NYISO Downstate** â€“ 10 buses  
    - ðŸŸª **IESO** (Ontario/Quebec) â€“ 31 buses  
    - ðŸŸ§ **MISO** (Michigan) â€“ 10 buses
